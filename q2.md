## Question 2 - Search pattern

Please write a *function* that returns the index of the best match, when looking at an array of values.

```php
$needle = "London, England, uk";
$haystack = array(
	1 => array("London", "Ontario", "Canada"),
	8 => array("Greater London", "England", "UK"),
	4 => array("London", "England", "United Kingdom"),
	9 => array("London", "California", "United States")
);

echo best_match($needle, $haystack);

function best_match($needle, $haystack)
{
	// Your code here
}
```

What I am looking for is code that can analyse and compare each element of each array and rank them according to the the number of characters that are matched in each.

Expected output: 
```
8
```
Tip: be careful about case sensitivity and spaces.
