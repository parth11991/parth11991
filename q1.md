## Question 1 - OO FizzBuzz 

This is a classic test, but I would like you to think about it in a different, object-oriented way.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100:
- For multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 5 print "Buzz". 
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz".

I would like you to write a Class for this task.

```php
<?php
// Variables

class FizzBuzz
{
	// Your code here
}
```
The expected result is:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
... etc.
```
