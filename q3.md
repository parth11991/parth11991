## Question 3 - Hierarchies

I would like you to implement a solution that prints out hierarchies, based on the data below (these could be navigation trees).

You have the following array:

```php
$locations = array(
	3 => array("Building1", 2),
	2 => array("Area1", 1),
	0 => array("Floor1", 3),
	1 => array("City1"),
	4 => array("Room1", 0),

	13 => array("Building2", 12),
	12 => array("Area2", 11),
	14 => array("Room2", 10),
	10 => array("Floor2", 13),
	11 => array("City2")
);
```
The structure of the array is as follows:
```
key => array(term, parent_id)
```
In each element of the array, the second value points to the parent of the element itself. So for instance in the first array, ```City1``` is the root element and ```Area1``` is the first child, because the second element of ```Area1``` is ```1```, which is the ```key``` of  ```City1```.

The expected output is:
```
City1 > Area1 > Building1 > Floor1 > Room1
City2 > Area2 > Building2 > Floor2 > Room2
```
**Tip**. Think abstract and think about recursion.
**Plus points**. Write this as an Object Oriented Class
