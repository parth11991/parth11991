## Keepthinking's PHP code assignments

Dear Candidate,

thank you for agreeing to take part in this test. This is to assess your current level and the more you do, the better.

There are 5 questions/tasks, linked below - you should provide answers to all of them. Feel free to use any text editor you are used to, which allows you to run the code. On a Mac, I recommend a trial version of [CodeRunner](https://coderunnerapp.com/).

When you are finished, please email me your solutions.

Now the questions:

- [Question 1](q1.md)
- [Question 2](q2.md)
- [Question 3](q3.md)
- [Question 4](q4.md)
- [Question 5](q5.md)

I am really thankful for you to take this test and I look forward to your results.

With best regards

Cristiano Bianchi
